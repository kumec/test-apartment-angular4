# MyApp & Task

Task for frontend and backend developer
We want you to build a housing administration for living quarters/ vacant apartments.
Please use the following technologies: PHP 7, PostgreSQL and for the frontend components
ideally Angular 4.

The housing administration should include the following features:
* add/create apartments
* edit/delete apartments
* view apartment
* view all apartments in a list

In addition to the basic functions another feature has to be included: The “creator” of an
apartment should be asked for his email address.
If the apartment has been saved successfully then the “creator” will receive an email with a
link to edit or delete the apartment.

The link may have the following structure:
Immoboard.local/apartments/edit/256?token=eerfrejhj43543tdsferdgr

Important: It should only be possible to edit or delete the apartment via the link (with token)

We rate your result by the following criteria:
* functionality
* coding style
* legibility
* documentation

You are free to choose the data you request regarding the apartment. The design or look of
your result is not so important, but we are always happy to look at a visually appealing
implementation.

Important is that everything works fine and that we see that the logic has been implemented
in PHP and the frontend in AngularJS.

Either you send us the files with an understandable installation guide or far better: You send
us a link to the installed, runnable program version of the test task and a link to a git-repository
where we can have a look at the code.

In case of questions please feel free to contact us anytime.

## Install

* Checkout code
* Install Node.js® and npm
* Install Angular-cli
* Install Bower
* Install dependency

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
